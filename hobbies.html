                        James' mother started him playing the piano at the young age of 12 years 
                        old.  Unlike other kids who were made to do things by their parents, James
                        enjoyed playing the piano.  He admits that he slacked-off from playing in
                        his early twenties and picking it back up after purchasing his own piano
                        when he was 27.  Although James could play gospel music, most of his time
                        was spent practicing classical pieces by Beethoven, Bach and Mozart.  His
                        favorite piece to play was "Moonlight Sonata" by Ludwig Von<br> Beethoven.

                        One of James' favorite activities was working on cars.  His knowledge of 
                        cars saved him a lot of money in auto repairs.  He spent a lot of time 
                        during the 80's trying to rebuild his Chevy Super Bee, which he eventually
                        let go.

                        One of the things that James was well known for was his cooking skill.
                        Whether it was firing up his homemade grill (made out of an old oil 
                        barrel) to fill hungry stomachs at the church picnic, or in the kitchen 
                        baking his famous cookies and peanut clusters to fill holiday orders,
                        James put his heart and soul into every dish.  He also enjoyed cooking 
                        for large gatherings.
