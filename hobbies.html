                    James' mother started him playing the piano at the young age of 12 years 
                    old.  Unlike other kids who were made to do things by their parents, James
                    enjoyed playing the piano.  He admits that he slacked-off from playing in
                    his early twenties and picking it back up after purchasing his own piano
                    when he was 27.  Although James could play gospel music, most of his time
                    was spent practicing classical pieces by Beethoven, Bach and Mozart.  His
                    favorite piece to play was "Moonlight Sonata" by Ludwig Von<br> Beethoven.

                    One of James' favorite activities was working on cars.  His knowledge of 
                    cars saved him a lot of money in auto repairs.  He spent a lot of time 
                    during the 80's trying to rebuild his Chevy Super Bee, which he eventually
                    let go.

                    One of the things that James was well known for was his cooking skill.
                    Whether it was firing up his homemade grill (made out of an old oil 
                    barrel) to fill hungry stomachs at the church picnic, or in the kitchen 
                    baking his famous cookies and peanut clusters to fill holiday orders,
                    James put his heart and soul into every dish.  He also enjoyed cooking 
                    for large gatherings.
