                    Pastor James J Brown Jr is a native of Omaha, Nebraska and has lived there for the majority of his life. His father, 
                    Pastor James J Brown Sr, started his own church in Council Bluffs, Iowa called Calvary Baptist Church, where James 
                    served as an associate minister, later to serve in the roles of assistant pastor, and eventually head pastor after 
                    the passing of his father. Although he came from a very Christian-oriented family, growing up in the midst of the 
                    Civil Rights Movement influenced his political views heavily as a youth, to the point of getting himself fired from 
                    jobs. Throughout his life, he served in many different positions within the church, as well as held a variety of 
                    different jobs do to him possessing multiple skill sets. After his first marriage ended in divorce in 1975, he 
                    managed to find love again after 10 years and remarried. He was a man who dreamed big, and one of those dreams was
                    to start his own catering business, as he was well known for his cooking talents, especially in the area of baking. 
                    People would flock to place orders for his chocolate chip cookies and his homemade chocolate peanut clusters. 
                    These are the two things he was most passionate about – cooking and the ministry. Whether it was being a minister 
                    in his father’s Baptist church, pastoring an AME church (African-Methodist-Episcopal) every second and fourth 
                    Sunday, or singing in a Seventh-Day Adventist men’s chorus, he exercised the principles and reflected within himself 
                    the qualities of being a man of God and the people.<br><br>
